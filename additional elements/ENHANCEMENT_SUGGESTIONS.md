# Orthonormal Basis Constructions with Gram-Schmidt Algorithm

## üéØ **Project Overview**

This interactive notebook demonstrates the **Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization process** and **QR matrix decomposition** - fundamental algorithms that power many machine learning and data science techniques. Through step-by-step mathematical derivations, from-scratch implementations, and 3D visualizations, you'll discover how linearly independent vectors transform into orthonormal bases.

### üî¨ **What You'll Explore Here:**
- **Mathematical Foundation**: Complete derivation of the Gram-Schmidt algorithm with geometric intuition
- **Custom Implementation**: Build QR decomposition from first principles using only NumPy
- **Interactive Visualizations**: See how matrices transform vector spaces in 3D
- **Numerical Validation**: Verify orthonormality conditions and decomposition accuracy

### üöÄ **Real-World Applications:**
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Dimensionality reduction in machine learning
- **Computer Graphics**: 3D rotations, camera transformations, and rendering pipelines  
- **Signal Processing**: Noise reduction, compression, and feature extraction
- **Least Squares Regression**: Solving overdetermined linear systems efficiently
- **Quantum Computing**: Unitary operations and state vector manipulations

### üßÆ **Mathematical Journey:**
Starting with any set of linearly independent vectors **{v‚ÇÅ, v‚ÇÇ, ..., v‚Çò}**, the Gram-Schmidt process systematically constructs an orthonormal basis **{w‚ÇÅ, w‚ÇÇ, ..., w‚Çò}** where each vector is perpendicular to all others and has unit length. This enables the powerful **A = QR** decomposition, separating rotation (**Q**) from scaling/shearing (**R**) transformations.
