# Matrix Decompositions Implementation for SVD & PCA

A comprehensive implementation of matrix decomposition algorithms with a focus on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This repository provides educational implementations of fundamental linear algebra techniques used in machine learning and data analysis.

## üìö Overview

This project implements various matrix decomposition methods from scratch, providing detailed mathematical explanations and practical demonstrations. The implementations are designed for educational purposes and include:

- **Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization & QR Decomposition**
- **Householder Reflection Methods**
- **SVD Demonstrations**

## üöÄ Features

### Gram-Schmidt QR Decomposition (`Gram_Schmidt_QR_Decomposition.py`)

An interactive Marimo notebook that implements the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization process and QR decomposition:

- **Orthogonalization Process**: Converts linearly independent vectors into orthonormal basis
- **QR Decomposition**: Decomposes matrix A into orthonormal matrix Q and upper triangular matrix R
- **Mathematical Explanations**: Detailed mathematical formulations and geometric interpretations
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Step-by-step process demonstration

#### Key Functions:
- `gs_Orthogonalization(X)`: Performs Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization
- `gs_QR_Decomposition(X)`: Complete QR decomposition using Gram-Schmidt
- `is_Orthonormal(Q)`: Validates orthonormality of matrix Q

#### Mathematical Foundation:
For a set of linearly independent vectors {v‚ÇÅ, v‚ÇÇ, ..., v‚Çò}, the process constructs orthonormal basis {w‚ÇÅ, w‚ÇÇ, ..., w‚Çò} where:

```
A = QR
```

Where:
- Q ‚àà ‚Ñù‚ÅøÀ£·µè contains orthonormal columns
- R ‚àà ‚Ñù·µèÀ£·µè is upper triangular matrix
- Q^T Q = I (orthonormality condition)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- NumPy
- Marimo (for interactive notebooks)

### Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/PragyanTiwari/Matrix-Decompositions-Implementation-for-SVD-PCA.git
cd Matrix-Decompositions-Implementation-for-SVD-PCA

# Install dependencies
pip install numpy marimo

# Run the Gram-Schmidt notebook
marimo run Gram_Schmidt_QR_Decomposition.py
```

### Quick Example
```python
import numpy as np
from Gram_Schmidt_QR_Decomposition import gs_QR_Decomposition

# Define a matrix with linearly independent columns
A = np.array([[1, 0, 0], 
              [2, 0, 3], 
              [4, 5, 6]]).T

# Perform QR decomposition
Q, R = gs_QR_Decomposition(A)

# Verify decomposition: A ‚âà Q @ R
print("Original matrix A:")
print(A)
print("\nOrthonormal matrix Q:")
print(Q)
print("\nUpper triangular matrix R:")
print(R)
print(f"\nVerification (A ‚âà Q@R): {np.allclose(A, Q @ R)}")
```

## üìñ Mathematical Background

### Gram-Schmidt Process
The Gram-Schmidt process transforms a set of linearly independent vectors into an orthonormal set by:

1. **Orthogonalization**: Remove projections of each vector onto previous ones
2. **Normalization**: Scale to unit length

Mathematical formulation:
```
u‚ÇÅ = v‚ÇÅ
w‚ÇÅ = u‚ÇÅ/‚Äñu‚ÇÅ‚Äñ

For i = 2, 3, ..., m:
u·µ¢ = v·µ¢ - Œ£‚±º‚Çå‚ÇÅ‚Å±‚Åª¬π proj_w‚±º(v·µ¢)
w·µ¢ = u·µ¢/‚Äñu·µ¢‚Äñ
```

### QR Decomposition
Every matrix A with linearly independent columns can be factored as A = QR, where Q has orthonormal columns and R is upper triangular.
